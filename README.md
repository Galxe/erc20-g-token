# G Token

This is the official repository for G Token.

The G Token is a new token contract replacing the old token `GAL`, proposed in
[GP25](https://dao.galxe.com/#/proposal/0x8d3f386c3b0cb9fa170d4231c65f18bd45ea1402b90a70116e1101c22e62ed01).

There are 3 contracts in this repository:

- `GravityTokenG.sol`: The main new ERC20 token contract, the G token. This token contract natively supports minter
  management for making G a native cross-chain token. Each minter will have limited minting power within a time window.
  Minters are enumerable. Implementation of this management is in `LimitedMinterManager.sol`.
- `TokenUpgrader.sol`: A contract to upgrade the GAL token to the G token.
- `TokenVesting.sol`: A simple token vesting contract.

## Deployment

The contracts have been deployed at the following addresses:

### G Token

Token Name: Gravity

Token Symbol: G

Initial Total Supply: 12,000,000,000 G

Contract Address: `0x9C7BEBa8F6eF6643aBd725e45a4E8387eF260649`

  - Initial supply: 0 G
  - Note: G tokens will be bridged from other networks to Base network.

G tokens can be natively bridged to deployed network via our official bridge, using cross-chain message protocols.

### Token Upgrader

Only available on networks where the old GAL token is deployed:

- [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x249aC00402716b7bf6d6ED24531d7B4C10788942#code)
  - Ethereum Address: `0x249aC00402716b7bf6d6ED24531d7B4C10788942`
  - Owner: [Safe multi-sig on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbD6e434dB90FD8AD4E28d85C133AD34cA6fbfB6D)
- [BNB Chain](https://bscscan.com/address/0x35272c5e7236d1042Af432046706111e314d1577#code)
  - Owner: [Safe multi-sig on BNB Chain](https://bscscan.com/address/0xBB86C74ecCA362D007293EE8A2E24E9De0B9E558)
  - BSC address: `0x35272c5e7236d1042Af432046706111e314d1577`
  - Note: This upgrader is different from Ethereum's upgrader that burns GAL tokens by sending them to `0xdead` address.
    Instead, it will send the BEP-20 GAL token to the owner of the upgrader contract. The owner will then send those
    BEP-20 GAL tokens to the exchange that issued them, to burn and unlocked the original ERC-20 GAL tokens. Those
    ERC-20 GAL tokens will then be burned by sending to the `0xdead` address on Ethereum.

### G Token OFT

For chains that do not have G token contract deployed natively, we use Layerzero's OFT standard to bring G token to
those chains.
